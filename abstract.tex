Neural networks are biologically inspired computation models that have shaped the field of machine learning over the last decade, bringing about breakthroughs in numerous application areas ranging from image processing to natural language understanding. In this paper, we review the fundamental principles behind neural networks, providing the reader with the necessary mathematical knowledge to be able to use them in practice. We examine how neural networks have been developed from simpler models, their design, and their mathematical specification. We then explore algorithms to train neural networks in order that they can be used to solve a particular problem. Finally, we briefly discuss more advanced network architectures and the continued impact we believe neural networks will have on machine learning.
